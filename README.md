# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
In this analysis, a summary dataframe of the ride-sharing data by city type is created to plot a multiple-line graph to show the total weekly fares for each city type. The chart is plotted to analyze how the data differs by city type and how the differences can be used by the decision-maker.

## Results
From the summary dataframe below, the information of "Total Rides", "Total Drivers", "Total Fares", "Average Fare per Ride" and "Average Fare per Driver" for three different areas including "Rural", " Suburban" and "Urban" are listed. It can be observed that the urban area has the largest number of total rides, total drivers and the amount of total fares. However, for the items of "Average Fare per Ride" and "Average Fare per Driver", the rural area has the largest amount compared to suburban and urban area.  
  
From the multi-line plot below, among the three city types, Urban area has the highest weekly total fare and the majority of the amount fluctuates between 2000$ and 2500$. Rural area has the lowest weekly total fare, which fluctuates between 0$ and 500$. From January to the end of April, the weekly total fare for each city type does not change significantly.
